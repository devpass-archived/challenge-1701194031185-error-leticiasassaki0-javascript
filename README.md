# JavaScript Error Handling Challenge

In this challenge, you are required to implement a function that performs a division operation and handles the potential errors that can occur. The task is to create a function `divideNumbers` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number. However, if any errors occur during the division operation (such as division by zero or invalid input), the function should throw an appropriate error with a specific error message.

Your task is to implement the `divideNumbers` function and handle the error cases as specified.

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Testing

Run `npm test` to run the tests and validate your solution.
